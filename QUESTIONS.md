# Development Experience Questions

These few questions are an opportunity for you to share your experience and thoughts about certain topics concerning software development. Although no one is timing you, try to spend only about 15 minutes max answering these questions. Also, there is no expected length to the response, but please keep it around 2-3 paragraphs for each answer.

## Q1- Multi-threading & Concurrent processing

Have you encountered a circumstance where a process needed multithreading to function smoothly? Have you ever implemented concurrent processing in an application to boost throughput / response time?

Please share your experiences - whether describing a problem that you or your team resolved, your thoughts about when utilizing these tools becomes important, or something else.

*For your consideration:*

What are the main drawbacks to building multithreaded software, and how heavily do you weigh those tradeoffs when designing?

## Q2- Testing philosophy

We would like to hear your thoughts on testing code. Generally, describe your thoughts about testing as a part of the software engineering discipline. Specifically, describe how you go about ensuring that your code works the way you intend it to.

In practice professionally, how do you test your code? Describe how testing fits into your overall development workflow. How does testing fit into a team delivery?

*For your consideration:*

Can you describe your personal testing philosophy and give a list of pros and cons regarding where you feel your personal philosophy sits? *For example, you might feel that testing should be done by a testing team - what are the pros and cons of this approach over other contemporary approaches?*

## Q3- Optimization

We would like to hear about the your stance on optimizing code - there is a belief that as code becomes more optimized, it becomes less flexible and readable - but that might not always be the only tradeoff.

At what stage in the software lifecycle is optimization the most critical? Are there alternatives to optimization when the cost becomes restrictive? What is your personal experience in the area?

*For your consideration:*

Do you have any experiences with optimizing or over-optimizing code? How far is too far, and what is the cutoff between maintainability, flexibility and performance?
